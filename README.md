Current Stable Version: 1.0.0

- I can be blunt. Do not take it personally.
- I can be a smart-ass at times. Just tell me to stop and I will do my best to stop if it irks you.
- Do not take every piece of advice I give as gospel.
- Challenge my ideas. I am always looking for alternatives and will consider them.
- Ask me questions.
- Don't spin your wheels working on a problem, but don't immediately give up and come to me if you have not at least tried to get over your obstacle.
- If you don't like something I do, tell me. I can take it.
- Don't be a complete jerk to me, and I will do the same to you.
